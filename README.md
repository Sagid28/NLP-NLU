# Natural Language Processing(NLP) and Understanding(NLU) Portfolio
Welcome to my NLP/NLU showcase! In this repository, I've gathered a collection of Jupyter notebooks to demonstrate my foundational knowledge in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU). These notebooks showcase my understanding of various NLP concepts and applications.

## The repository includes the following notebooks:

**1. Building a Recurrent Neural Network**

Dive into the world of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and understand their applications in sequential data analysis.

**2. Basic Language Model**

Explore the fundamentals of creating a basic language model and learn how it can be used for text generation.

**3. Emoji Analysis**
Discover how to analyze and interpret emoji usage in text data.

**4. Neural Machine Translation with Attention**

Learn about Neural Machine Translation models, with a focus on attention mechanisms for improved translation quality.

**5. Operations on Word Vectors**

Explore the world of word embeddings and understand how to manipulate word vectors for various NLP tasks.

**6. Transformer Network**

Delve into the Transformer architecture, which has revolutionized NLP, and understand its key components.

**7. Transformer Application: Named Entity Recognition**

Apply the Transformer architecture to the Named Entity Recognition (NER) task, a critical aspect of information extraction.

**8. Transformer Application: Question Answering Dataset**

See how Transformers can be used for Question Answering, a fundamental NLP task, and work with relevant datasets.
These notebooks are a product of my journey in understanding NLP/NLU concepts and building practical skills, inspired by coursework from Coursera. 

Thank you for visiting my repository.
